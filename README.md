Deep Learning Course: Fundementals and applications
---------

This course is designed get learners up on the fundamentals and applications. It is designed for people who comfortable reading and writing intermediate Python code. 

The course is a mix of lecturs and hands-on with many applications.

Materials are both in PyTorch and TensorFlow/Keras.

It can be delivered as a 1/2 day, 1 day, 3 day, or more workshop.

Topics
----------

- General introduction to deep learning
- Linear algebra review
- Machine learning review
- What is a neural network?
- Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
- Backpropagation, aka backprop
